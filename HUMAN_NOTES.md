## NOTES

- This project is an experiment to discover what is possible with coding agents such as Claude Code. I have instructed Claude to not read this file as its content can be disturbing for him .. :) I have manually tested only a handful features at this stage. Telegram channel and TUI is working with one user, memory and session handling and everything else are not yet tested.

- If you read this note and know Erlang/OTP, please feel free to comment the architectural and design choices made by Claude.
